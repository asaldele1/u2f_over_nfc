## Shared Keys & Compatibility

All cryptographic keys and counters are stored in the standard location used by the official Flipper Zero U2F app. This means you can seamlessly use both the standard USB HID U2F application and this NFC application interchangeably with the same synced accounts and registrations!

## Usage

1. Launch the application. The screen will show the Dolphin animation with the text **"Ready. Bring to NFC reader"**.
2. When a service or website prompts you to tap your security key, bring the Flipper Zero close to the NFC reader.
3. The Flipper will seamlessly handle the `REGISTER` or `AUTHENTICATE` APDU commands and display the result.
